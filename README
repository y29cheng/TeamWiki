TeamWiki is a php project built on CakePHP framework. What it does is providing a platform for users to share social information. It also provides a certain level of interaction.

The project has a running cloud-based server hosted on phpfog.org. Check it out at teamwiki.phpfog.com. 

Note that I made the entire project to learn php and for fun. Source code is open for all watchers, but use at your own risk!
